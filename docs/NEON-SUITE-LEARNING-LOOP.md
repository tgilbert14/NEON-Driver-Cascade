# NEON suite learning loop

This is the durable program record for improving the nine product apps, deciding
whether a complementary app is warranted, and then returning to the Driver Response
Atlas with stronger data, estimators, and ecological understanding. The work is a
sequence of evidence-producing app passes, not nine isolated redesigns.

## Program outcome

Every app pass must produce two things:

1. a better, tested product app (or an evidence-backed no-change/withheld
   decision), published only when authorized and every release gate is green; and
2. a compact knowledge package that states what the Driver can adopt now, what must
   remain contextual or hypothetical, and what missing product would unlock.

This file, in the Driver repository, is the central suite register. Each sibling
keeps its detailed local handoff, but a completed app pass is not closed until its
knowledge package and Driver decision are recorded here.

The Driver is the integration layer. It should not absorb a metric merely because a
sibling displays it. A candidate Driver signal still needs a stable definition,
sampling/effort support, compatible site-year keys, a defensible scale, honest
missing/zero handling, and a pre-stated mechanism or an explicit context-only role.

## Ten-app inventory and sequence

The current Driver is the baseline and final integration target. The nine product
apps visible in the suite cover are:

1. NEON Small Mammal Tracker;
2. NEON Plant Diversity;
3. NEON Plant Phenology Explorer;
4. NEON Vegetation Structure Explorer;
5. NEON Ground Beetle Tracker;
6. NEON Mosquito Pulse;
7. NEON Breeding Birds;
8. NEON Water Chemistry Analyte Viewer; and
9. NEON My Little Inverts.

The default progression moves from the flagship and terrestrial foundation through
fast/slow consumers, then into the aquatic pair. The owner may change the order for
readiness or scientific dependency, but each app remains a separate completed pass.

```text
Driver baseline
  -> nine one-at-a-time product passes
  -> cross-product synthesis and gap audit
  -> optional complementary app, only if it unlocks a material Driver advance
  -> Driver v2 integration
  -> full suite cross-link/deployment audit
```

Likely complementary-product candidates already identified by the science roadmap
are discharge/streamflow, aquatic-site water temperature, or periphyton. This is a
decision after the nine app passes, not a commitment now. Build one only when the
evidence register shows that it fills a shared-driver or missing-producer hinge that
cannot be obtained honestly from the existing apps.

## One-app learning cycle

Run this cycle to completion before beginning the next app.

### 1. Freeze the starting evidence

- Read that repository's `AGENTS.md`, complete build/test handoff, and this suite
  loop (or a synchronized copy).
- Record timestamp/time zone, owner, objective, branch, commit, relevant tool
  versions, generated-data lineage and hashes, deployment target, live URL, and
  current test state.
- Inventory the starting worktree, existing user changes, and active publishers
  before editing; record the final ownership/status at close.
- State the product's sampling unit, observational unit, response opportunity, and
  effort denominator before judging charts or estimators.

### 2. Audit science and data from raw records upward

- Confirm the exact DPID/tables, sampling design, spatial support, revisit structure,
  censoring, structural zeros, missingness, and protocol changes.
- Recompute headline metrics with an independent raw-source oracle.
- Identify pseudoreplication, unequal opportunity, denominator, nested-area,
  detection, and snapshot-versus-trend traps.
- Write a `CAN / CANNOT / HELD` claim list before promoting new conclusions.
- Prefer a reviewed `NA` or context-only result over an unsupported estimate.

### 3. Improve the product app

- Preserve product-native units and scientific identity; reuse suite chrome and
  interaction patterns only where they remain honest.
- Make QC inspectable: flag -> exact rows -> export, phrased as "verify, not wrong."
- Keep startup bundle-only and network-independent; update the cover, social card,
  sibling registry, and direct GitHub Pages URL when publishing.
- Record any reusable UI, accessibility, packaging, browser, CI, or deployment
  pattern in `docs/neonize-playbook.md` rather than leaving it in chat history.

### 4. Verify adversarially

- Run static syntax, unit/contract, raw-oracle, build, determinism, manifest,
  runtime-boot, and desktop/mobile browser gates in the repository's required order.
- Test real user events, empty states, keyboard paths, exports, local-only boot
  assets, console/network failures, and published URLs.
- Include at least one fresh diff review focused separately on science/statistics,
  R correctness, frontend lifecycle/accessibility, and deployment/security.
- Record failed attempts and cleanup with the same care as passing evidence.
- Record exact commands, environment, expected result, actual result, and
  `PASS`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`N/A`; a screenshot or remembered outcome is not a gate.
- After publication, bind the green PR head, merge commit, and deployed Pages
  commit in one receipt. Verify stable desktop/mobile geometry after reload or
  remeasurement, canonical/social metadata, natural social-image dimensions,
  console/network health, and every public link; persistent overflow blocks release.

### 5. Produce the Driver knowledge package

Every app pass ends with the following fields. `Unknown` is valid; omission is not.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| Product identity | app/repository, DPID, immutable source commit, bundle/schema version |
| Unit and support | entity, sampling unit, spatial grain, temporal grain, revisit structure |
| Opportunity/effort | denominator, structural-zero rule, missingness, censoring, support gates |
| Trusted signals | definition, unit, direction meaning, uncertainty, exact eligible keys |
| Driver joins | compatible site/year/domain keys, match rate, proxy status, rejected joins |
| Mechanisms | candidate driver -> response, sign, lag, season, stratum, citations/status |
| Honesty limits | CAN / CANNOT / HELD statements and failure-closed outcomes |
| Reusable engineering | code/UI/QC/build/deploy pattern plus tests that proved it |
| Learning class | app-local, suite-platform, scientific-contract, and/or Driver-impacting |
| Driver decision | `ADOPT`, `HOLD`, `CONTEXT`, `COMPLEMENT`, or `REJECT`, with evidence |
| Next dependency | first missing data, method, or validation that would change the decision |

Use these decision meanings consistently:

- `NONE`: a reusable app/release lesson with no ecological Driver change.
- `ADOPT`: the Driver can implement the exact signal/mechanism now.
- `HOLD`: scientifically plausible but awaiting registered analysis, stronger support,
  or held-out observations.
- `CONTEXT`: useful descriptive state but not eligible to vote in Driver inference.
- `COMPLEMENT`: exposes a missing product/hinge worth evaluating after the nine apps.
- `REJECT`: incompatible scale, opportunity, join, or construct; preserve the reason.

### 6. Close the session durably

- Update the app-local handoff with exact commands, environment, expected/actual
  results, artifacts/hashes, invalidated evidence, failures, cleanup, residual risks,
  and next action.
- Update the suite register below and the Driver implication backlog.
- Promote reusable lessons to canonical instructions/playbooks, not only a dated log.
- Return Driver parity failures, incompatible keys/calendars, and missing audit
  fields to the owning app as explicit work rather than compensating silently.
- End with a clean ownership/status check and preserve unrelated work.

## Suite evidence register

This table is the program index. Detailed evidence stays in each app's repository.
Do not mark an app complete from memory or screenshots alone.

## Driver implication backlog

Add one row for every materially supported or rejected cross-product idea. Never
delete rejected ideas; their reasons prevent future sessions from repeating unsafe
work.

| Source app | Candidate signal/link | Decision | Evidence/support | Required Driver change | Blocker/next test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Driver baseline | temperature -> green-up | ADOPT (existing exploratory family) | 18 eligible sites; full details in Driver handoff | preserve exact lineage and sensitivities | re-evaluate after phenology pass |
| Driver baseline | plant richness as productivity | REJECT | composition is not productivity | keep context-only wording | evaluate periphyton/producer gap after aquatic passes |
| Driver baseline | beetle activity as CPUE | CONTEXT | denominator is catch-event-conditioned | no inferential vote | revisit after beetle effort audit |
| Driver baseline | aquatic climate bridge | COMPLEMENT | no direct terrestrial/aquatic site-code overlap | require explicit proxy or true aquatic driver | water chemistry + inverts passes, then gap audit |
| Driver release platform | canonical Ubuntu bytes + strict Windows oracle + independently validated CRAN/RSPM manifest normalization | NONE (suite-platform; validated) | family hashes, dual policy fixtures, raw-source oracle, boot/smoke evidence, and two clean exact-byte/semantic-manifest passes in Driver handoff | no scientific Driver change | reuse this release/test split in each app pass; never round artifacts or normalize unvalidated provenance |
| Driver release platform | fixed BLAS core and one-thread numeric runtime | NONE (suite-platform; validated) | unpinned run drifted; run `29644970791` attempts 1 and 2 loaded Haswell/one thread and reproduced exact bytes plus semantic manifest on unchanged head `526dd3b` | keep loaded core/thread assertions in CI and refresh, with no scientific rounding | reuse the exact loaded-runtime guard and two-run proof in each sibling app that publishes numeric artifacts |
| Driver release platform | PR/merge/Pages identity plus stable public browser receipt | NONE (suite-platform; validated) | final PR and master CI green; Pages built merge `430b0b0`; desktop/mobile, metadata, 1734x907 social asset, empty console, and 12/12 public links passed | no scientific Driver change | reuse the three-identity publication receipt; remeasure after viewport transitions and reject persistent overflow |

## Driver v2 reintegration gate

After the nine app passes, synthesize before coding. Driver v2 begins only when:

- all nine knowledge packages exist and their source commits are pinned;
- shared terms have one canonical definition and incompatible constructs stay split;
- site-year/domain joins and match rates are measured, with every proxy labeled;
- signal opportunity, effort, zero/missing, censoring, and support gates are explicit;
- directional priors are registered with sign, lag, season, stratum, citation, and
  exploratory/held status before examining any genuinely held-out result;
- complementary-product candidates are ranked by how many important Driver gaps
  they close, and the build/defer decision is recorded;
- every accepted Driver change has an independent adapter/raw-source oracle rather
  than executing sibling app code or copying a UI headline;
- each semantic change bumps affected bundle/search/meta schemas and updates the
  codebook, coverage, source lineage, search index, and exports;
- expected pre/post row/site counts, scientific pins, votes, sensitivities, meta
  results, headlines, and caveats are declared before rebuilding;
- no sibling input is consumed from a moving branch or half-reviewed app state;
  Driver integration uses only pinned, green source commits;
- each generated family names one canonical release-byte platform/toolchain,
  including any dispatched BLAS core and thread contract, or proves exact
  cross-platform bytes; other-platform diagnosis separates RDS
  headers/serialization, strict schema/key/text equality, hexadecimal numeric
  deltas, and embedded upstream-fingerprint propagation before counting drift;
- Windows/Linux portability is rechecked for locale ordering, justified numeric
  tolerances, line endings, manifest provenance, and immutable workflow pins; and
- the full artifact, manifest, boot-integrity, browser, publication, and rollback
  matrix is rerun for the final unchanged integration.

The desired result is not a larger app at any cost. It is a better-grounded map of
ecological drivers whose links say exactly what the NEON data can and cannot support.
